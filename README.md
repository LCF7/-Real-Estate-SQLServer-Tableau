# Real-Estate-SQLServer-Tableau: Property Prices Analysis in Waterloo Region

## Project Overview
This project leverages Tableau to analyze and visualize property prices in the Waterloo region. It aims to demonstrate a comprehensive setup of Business Intelligence (BI) infrastructure, from data modeling in SQL Server to integration with Tableau, thus enabling impactful visualizations and insights.

## SQL Server in the Project
SQL Server serves as the foundation of our visualization strategy. Extensive data modeling and normalization have been performed to ensure that the data feeding into Tableau is accurate and reliable for effective visual comparisons.

## Data Model

### Objective
The main goal of this project is to evaluate and compare visualization capabilities against a PowerBI project.

## Project Steps
- **Database and Schema Setup**
  - A SQL Server database was created, and schemas were defined for structured data storage.

## Additional Considerations
- **Security:** Security measures were implemented to protect data integrity and restrict access.
- **Maintenance:** Maintenance protocols were outlined to ensure the long-term reliability and performance of the database and visualizations.
- **Maps:** Geographic visualizations were employed using maps, which will be compared with similar visualizations in other tools for a thorough geographic data analysis.

## Comparison with Other BI Tools
The project will include detailed comparisons with other visualization tools such as Power BI to identify strengths and weaknesses, thereby determining the most suitable BI platforms for different industry applications.

## Conclusion
Tableau proves to be a robust tool for those requiring detailed data visualization and strong integration capabilities. This project highlights how well-structured data modeling and sophisticated BI tools can transform raw data into actionable insights.
